\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

After the theoretical analysis, the simulation and the results' comparison, it can be
concluded that the design and analysis of a bandpass filter, presented in Figure-\ref{fig:circuit},
has been accomplished with satisfaction.\par
There were performed both a theoretical and a simulation analysis, where the importance of this
kind of circuits became noticeable. Once more, this laboratory assignment allowed us to contact with
a more realistic situation forcing us to integrate all of our knowledge acquired untill
the present time, allowing us to deeply understand the diference between an ideal and an aproximated
model of a component(s).\par
We obtained good values of gain and central frequency, both with small deviation from the
requested specifications for the circuit in study.
Concluding, we were able to achieve the proposed objective and became more aware of the real context
of the applications of this course lectures.
