\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

After the theoretical analysis, the simulation and the results' comparison, it can be
concluded that, despite the objective of the work, the design and analysis of a AC/DC converter
circuit, presented in Figure-\ref{fig:circuit}, has been accomplished.\par

There were performed a theoretical analysis, in which it was applyedthe nodes method,
for t<0 and for $v_s$=0, and it was determined the natural, forced ad total solutions for
voltage $v_6$, such as the frequency responses for $v_s$, $v_c$ and $v_6$, using the Octave
maths tool. Furthermore, a circuit simulation, using the Ngspice tool, with which it was
simulated the operating point for t<0 and for $v_s$=0, the natural and total responses on node 6
and the frequency response in the same node. With these, it is clear a match of the theoretical
and the simulation results. The achievement of the equality in results comes from the fact that the models used to solve and analyse the circuit are similar in both the theoretical analysis and the simulation.
