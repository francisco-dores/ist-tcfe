\subsection{Operating Point Analysis for t<0}

\par Table~\ref{tab:op_tb0} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit
under analysis, when t<0.
\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
    \hline    
    {\bf Name} & {\bf Value [A or V]} \\ \hline
    \input{../sim/tb0_tab}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Operating point. A variable followed by [i] or [current] is of type {\em current}
    and expressed in Ampere; other variables are of type {\it voltage} and expressed in
    Volt.}
  \label{tab:op_tb0}
\end{table}

\par  As we can see, the simulation results are similar to the ones we obtained in the section \ref{sec:analysis}, concerning both the numerical values and the directions. As expected, the current through the capacitor is $i_c=0$.

\subsection{Analysis for t=0}
\label{subsec:t0}  


\par Table~\ref{tab:op_vs0} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit
under analysis,  when t=0.
\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
    \hline    
    {\bf Name} & {\bf Value [A or V]} \\ \hline
    \input{../sim/vs0_tab}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Operating point. A variable followed by [i] or [current] is of type {\em current}
    and expressed in Ampere; other variables are of type {\it voltage} and expressed in
    Volt.}
  \label{tab:op_vs0}
\end{table}


When t=0, the voltage $v_s$ drops to the value $v_s=0$, resulting in a discontinuity. However, because $i_c=\dv{v_c}{t}$, the voltage in the capacitor must be continuous for $t=0⁻, t=0, t=0⁺$, otherwise, the current $i_c$ would be infinite. Taking this into account, we replaced the capacitor with a voltage source $V_x=V_6(0⁻)-V_8(0⁻)$ that ensures this continuity. Note that, as whe can see in the table, the values of $V_6$ and $V_8$ in the nodes suffered a discontinuity in order to maintain $v_c$. 

The values obtained in simulation for t=0 are also similar to the ones we get from theoretical analysis in subsection \ref{subsec:t=0}.

\subsection{Analysis for t>0 - Natural Solution}

\par Figure~\ref{fig:trans_nat} shows the plot of the natural solution for $v_6$, when t>0.

\begin{figure}[h] \centering

\caption{Natural solution}
\label{fig:trans_nat}
\end{figure}

To simulate the natural solution, we imposed the boundary conditions for continuity obtained in last section, $V_6$ and $V_8$, with the voltage source $v_s=0$. As we can see, the plot is similar to the one obtained in subsection \ref{subsec:nat}, showing a negative exponential.

\subsection{Analysis for t>0 - Total Solution}

\par Figure~\ref{fig:trans_nat} shows the plot of the total (natural+forced) solution for $v_6$ and $v_s$, when t>0. Here we defined $v_s(t)=sin(2\pift)$ as the voltage source. The plot is similar to the one obtained in subsection \ref{subsec:total_solution}.

\begin{figure}[h] \centering

\end{figure}

\subsection{Frequency Response}

\par In this section we simulated the frequency response of $v_s$, $v_6$ and $v_c=v_6-v_8$ from frequency $0.1 Hz$ to $1 MHz$. The plot \ref{fig:magnitude} shows the magnitude response while plot \ref{fig:phase} shows the phase response. The plots are similar to the ones obtained in subsection \ref{subsec:frequency_response}
