\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In this laboratory assignment it will be analysed a circuit composed by four
elementary meshes. The circuit includes seven resistors $R_i$, a voltage source
$V_s$, a current controlled voltage source $V_d$, a voltage controlled current
source $I_b$ and a capacitor $C$. The circuit described is portrayed in
Figure-\ref{fig:circuit}.

Throughout the report it is presented a theoretical analysis, a simulation of the
circuit and its analysis as well as a comparison of the obtained results. \par
In Section~\ref{sec:analysis},  it is applyed the nodes methods, in order to do
a theoretical analysis of the circuit, using the Octave maths tool.
In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, it is executed an analysis of the circuit using
the Ngspice tool to simulate it.
In Sectione~\ref{sec:comparison}, reults obtained with both Octave and Ngspice are
displayed side-by-side, in order to compare the results.
Lastly, in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}, it is performed a conclusion, bearing in mind the
results from both the theoretical analysis and the simulation, from Section~\ref{sec:analysis}
and Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, respectively.
