\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

After the theoretical analysis, the simulation and the results' comparison, it can be
concluded that the design and analysis of the amplifier circuit, presented in Figure-\ref{fig:circuit}, has been accomplished.\par

There were performed both a theoretical and a simulation analysis, where the importance of this kind of circuits became noticeable. This laboratory assignment allowed us to contact with a more realistic problem in a way that its goal forced us to integrate all of our knowledge acquired untill this moment, and allowed us to understand what is in stake when we need to use models to aproximate a circuit. Beyond this, the circuit analysed is very usefull on our daily life.
We managed to obtain a good value of gain, wich means that the amplification was successfull
Concluding, we were able to achieve the proposed objective and became more aware of the real context of the applications of this course lectures.
