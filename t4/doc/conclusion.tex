\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

After the theoretical analysis, the simulation and the results' comparison, it can be
concluded that, despite the objective of the work, the design and analysis of a AC/DC converter
circuit, presented in Figure-\ref{fig:circuit}, has been accomplished.\par

There were performed both a theoretical and a simulation analysis, where the non linearity of some components became noticeable. This laboratory assignment allowed us to constact with a more realistic and complex problem in a way that its goal forced us to integrate all of our knowledge acquired untill this moment, and made us understand what is in stake when we need to use models to aproximate a circuit.
It became clear thet Ngspice is a powerfull tool in circuit solving, representing a good resource in a possible future problem in the industry context.
Concluding, we were able to achieve the proposed objective and became more aware of the real context of the applications of this course lectures.
