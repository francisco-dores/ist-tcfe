\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The goal of this laboratory assignment is to model and analyse an audio amplifier
circuit, by designing both Gain and Output amplifier stages.\par

The circuit annalised is formed by two voltage sources, $V_{in}$ and $V_{CC}$,
seven resistors, $R_S$, $R_{B1}$, $R_{B2}$, $R_{C1}$, $R_{E1}$, $R_{E2}$ and $R_L$,
three capacitors, $C_i$, $C_b$ and $C_o$, and two transformers. The circuit described
is portrayed in Figure-\ref{fig:circuit}.\par

Throughout the report it is presented a theoretical analysis, a simulation of the
circuit and its analysis as well as a comparison of the obtained results. \par

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, it is executed an incremental analysis, in order to
do a theoretical analysis of the circuit, using the Octave maths tool.
In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, it is executed an analysis of the circuit using
the Ngspice tool to simulate it.
In Section~\ref{sec:comparison}, reults obtained with both Octave and Ngspice are
displayed side-by-side, in order to compare the results.
Lastly, in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}, it is performed a conclusion, bearing in mind the
results from both the theoretical analysis and the simulation, from Section~\ref{sec:analysis}
and Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, respectively.\par
