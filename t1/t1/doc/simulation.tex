\subsection{Operating Point Analysis}

\par Table~\ref{tab:op_sim} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit
under analysis.
\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
    \hline    
    {\bf Name} & {\bf Value [A or V]} \\ \hline
    \input{../sim/op_tab}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Operating point. A variable followed by [i] or [current] is of type {\em current}
    and expressed in Ampere; other variables are of type {\it voltage} and expressed in
    Volt.}
  \label{tab:op_sim}
\end{table}

\par  As we can see, the simulation results are similar to the ones we obtained in the section \ref{sec:analysis}, concerning both the numerical values and the directions. Note that, unlike the table \ref{tab:op_analysis}, in the simulation results we present an extra voltage at node 8, $V_8$, that is a "dummy" node used to compute the dependent voltage source.
