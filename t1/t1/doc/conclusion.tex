\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

After the theoretical analysis and the simulation, it can be concluded that the
objective of the work, the study of the circuit presented in Figure-\ref{fig:circuit},
has been accomplished. \par
There were performed a theoretical analysis, applying mesh and nodes methods,
using the Octave maths tool, and a circuit simulation, using the Ngspice tool, with which is clear a seamless match of the theoretical and the simulation results. The achievement of the equality in results comes from the components of the circuit, which are all linear and, therefore, both analysis have to present the same results. Also, comes from the fact that the models used to solve and analyse the circuit are similar in both the theoretical analysis and the simulation.
